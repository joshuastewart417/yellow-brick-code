                <p>Dorothy Gale is the protagonist of the broad Oz novels, written by L. Frank Baum. Her first appearance
                    was in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

                    She is an ordinary girl from Kansas who runs away from home when her nasty neighbor Miss Gulch threatens
                    to file a lawsuit to take/demolish her family's farm and tries to kill her dog Toto. But when a kind
                    gypsy named Professor Marvel convinces her that her family and friends care about her, she goes back.
                    She is swept up in a tornado and sent to the magical land of Oz. Glinda the witch of the north sends her
                    on a quest to find the local Wizard to help her get home and escape the clutches of her archenemy, the
                    Wicked Witch of the West who is after the Ruby Slippers Dorothy got from her dead sister. Along the way
                    she befriends the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion (Old Hunk, Hickory, and Zeke in Kansas) who all
                    want something from the Wizard as well.</p>
