                <p>Scarecrow is a being from the magical Land of Oz, and is the first companion and loyal comrade that Dorothy Gale and her dog, Toto, discovered on their journey down the Yellow Brick Road while traveling to see the great and powerful Wizard. Dorothy encouraged the Scarecrow to join her and to ask the Wizard for a set of brains, which he thought he lacked. In the end of the story, he eventually did receive what he desired, and in Baum's subsequent Oz books; becomes known as one of the cleverest figures in all of Oz.</p>
